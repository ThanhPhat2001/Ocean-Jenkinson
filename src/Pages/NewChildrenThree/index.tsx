                    Do fish need protein? In short, the answer is yes. But the
                    full answer is more complicated. Different species of fish
                    crave different types of protein. If you're raising aquarium
                    fish, you need to know which protein your fish prefer so you
                    can make sure they get the right food to live happy, healthy
                    lives.

                    Like most animals, aquarium fish fall into three categories
                    when it comes to the food they eat. Some are herbivores
                    (preferring to eat plant-based proteins), some are
                    carnivores (preferring meat-based proteins), and others are
                    omnivores (happy to eat plants or meat).
                  </span>
                </p>
                <h2>Herbivores Forage All Day</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    In the wild, herbivores forage off and on all day, eating a
                    little at a time because they don't have an actual stomach.
                    Instead, they have an extra-long intestine designed to break
                    down plant material and specially shaped teeth to help them
                    scrape algae off rocks. This is why you may want to keep
                    some live plants in your aquarium. Your fish may not only
                    swim and play among the leaves, but they might want to
                    nibble on them too.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Examples of fish that prefer vegetarian meals include silver
                    dollars, mollies, and twig catfish.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Look for flakes or algae-based pellets designed for their
                    plant-based diets. If you have freshwater shrimp, they'll
                    want herbivore food that sinks to the bottom, where they
                    spend most of their time. The same goes for bottom feeders
                    like some species of catfish, which prefer algae-rich
                    sinking food.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    You can even mix in some fresh vegetables from time to time,
                    like skinned peas, small slices of raw zucchini, or fresh
                    spinach (without stems).
                  </span>
                </p>
                <h2>Carnivores Like Small Prey</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Carnivorous aquarium fish tend to have large stomachs, so
                    they can eat more food at once than their herbivore
                    counterparts (and they can go longer between meals). They
                    may occasionally eat plants but don't really get many
                    nutrients from them. Look for protein-rich food designed
                    especially for carnivores.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Smaller carnivores that live in aquariums, like betta fish,
                    enjoy eating insects and invertebrates in the wild rather
                    than other fish. That's why you might want to consider
                    protein-rich flakes or pellets that are 100% fish-free.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Carnivorous fish like betta also love hunting. They prefer
                    hunting tiny prey, like mosquito larvae, brine shrimp, or
                    bloodworms. Mix in some live food from time to time, and
                    they'll be loving their aquarium habitat.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <h2>Omnivores Eat Everything</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Omnivores will eat both plant-based and meat-based proteins.
                    Discus, for example, enjoy eating plant material but also
                    forage for worms or small crustaceans at the bottom of the
                    tank. Every now and then, give omnivores like discus a
                    little frozen or live food for an extra special treat —
                    especially if you want them to spawn. Omnivores appreciate
                    it if their diet is rotated so they have variety.
                  </span>

                  </span>
                </p>
                <h2>Alternate the Types of Protein You Feed</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    If you keep a mix of herbivores and carnivores, you need to
                    alternate your protein types so everyone gets what they
                    prefer. Many fish that aren't herbivores still enjoy plant
                    proteins. Catfish, for example, need a lot of vegetables in
                    their diet, and even goldfish and guppies enjoy some
                    veggies.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Make sure you also take their sizes into account when
                    feeding. Tiny neon tetras can't eat large pellets, and
                    larger fish may not want tiny flakes. Your ground-dwelling
                    fish may also prefer sinking pellets to food that floats at
                    the surface.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <h2>Give Your Fish Protein-Rich Treats</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Whether your fish are picky carnivores or hungry omnivores,
                    they'll all enjoy a little variety from time to time. That's
                    why it's important to have a high-protein, tasty treat on
                    hand to mix things up.

                    Aqueon Stick'ems are soft, freeze-dried treats rich in both
                    protein and taste. They contain a nutritious mix of brine
                    and Mysis shrimp that tempt even the pickiest fish. These
                    new fish treats are available online and on your favorite
                    pet store shelves and come in three varieties.

                    Stick'ems are fun for both you and your pet fish. You can
                    stick them to the side of the aquarium glass and watch your
                    fish up close as they dine, allowing you to be part of the
                    feeding experience. This gives you a more personal look at
                    your fish's mealtime habits than ever before. You can watch
                    them nibble happily on the treat up close, capture the
                    closeness of the fish in some fun pics, and see all their
                    antics as they dine on your special treats, making feeding
                    time more interactive.

                    Although all fish need protein, the type of protein needed
                    varies from fish to fish. That's why it's important to
                    understand the unique needs of each of your finned pets. But
                    no matter what type of fish you have, they can all benefit
                    from tasty protein treats mixed with their regular feedings.
