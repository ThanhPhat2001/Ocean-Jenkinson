                    Sometimes sitting in front of an aquarium full of gentle
                    fish is enough to let all your cares drift away. The soft
                    swish of fins, their beautiful colors, and the tranquility
                    of aquarium life can give anyone a relaxed sense of peace.

                    The phrase "aquarium therapy" was coined around the 1990s to
                    highlight how beneficial owning an aquarium can be in
                    reducing stress — even the CDC acknowledges that owning fish
                    can help calm you. If you're looking to de-stress your life,
                    check out these five ways owning an aquarium can help bring
                    peace and calm to your world.

                <h2>1. Aquariums Are Relaxing and Calming</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    The soft sound of moving water in an aquarium can be very
                    soothing. It's so relaxing that it's often used in
                    relaxation music and apps. But water alone isn't enough to
                    produce the relaxing, calming effects we love from
                    aquariums. Researchers compared how calming an empty
                    aquarium filled with water is compared to an aquarium with
                    fish. They determined that having more fish (or even any
                    fish at all) increases the calming effect on our bodies.

                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Some people believe this is due to the back-and-forth, soft
                    swimming movement of fish, lulling you into a sense of peace
                    similar to hypnosis. Others think it's the connection to
                    nature that soothes you.

                <h2>2. Fish Can Improve Your Mood</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Caring for fish doesn't just relax you, but it can also
                    improve your mood. There's something special about watching
                    brightly colored fish swimming in your tank, knowing you've
                    made a difference in their well-being. Caring for any pet —
                    fish or mammal — can help ease loneliness. And even though
                    you can't physically cuddle your fish, studies have shown
                    that watching fish can lift your mood.

                  3. Aquariums May Help Reduce Blood Pressure and Heart Rates
                </h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Aquariums have tangible effects on our physiology, including
                    lowering blood pressure. While an empty aquarium with just
                    plants can help improve your blood pressure, you're more
                    likely to see results with an aquarium full of fish. It may
                    even help reduce your heart rate in just a few minutes.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <h2>4. Fish May Help Reduce Anxiety and Muscle Tension</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Keeping fish can help calm you when you experience a case of
                    the jitters. This calming effect is why you often see
                    aquariums in dentists' and doctors' offices — to help
                    patients relax before their appointments.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>

                    <img src={blog_childrenone_img} alt="" />
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    This is perhaps partly due to aquarium therapy's ability to
                    help decrease muscle tension, which can bring a greater
                    sense of well-being. And all this relaxation might even help
                    you sleep better.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <h2>5. Watching Fish Encourages You to Slow Down</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Aquariums are quiet and slow. To really understand and
                    connect with your fish, you have to sit quietly and observe
                    them. But the experience can be even more fulfilling if you
                    go beyond observation and interact with your fish. Try
                    playing gentle games with your fish, watching them closely
                    when you feed them, and giving them treats. Use this time to
                    practice your photography skills with your smartphone and
                    take fun photos of your fish.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Aquarium life provides a sharp contrast to the fast pace of
                    the world, with expectations and demands always pressing in.
                    Aquariums — like yoga or meditation — allow you to still
                    your thoughts.

                <h2>Aquariums Are a Beneficial Investment</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Aquariums are a worthwhile investment that benefits the
                    entire family: from your youngest child to your
                    grandparents. The soothing water and gentle fish can relax
                    your muscles, lower your heart rate, and give you an overall
                    sense of well-being. If you find yourself more stressed than
                    usual, consider adding an aquarium to your living room. It
                    may bring the soothing calmness you need.
