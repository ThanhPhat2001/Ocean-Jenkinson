                    If you're searching for ways to spoil your finned friends,
                    treats are the way to go! Yes, your aquarium fish can have —
                    and would enjoy — some tasty nibbles between regular
                    feedings. If you've ever wondered what fish can eat as
                    treats, how often you should offer them, or why this is a
                    good idea, keep reading.

                    As you browse for your usual fish food supplies, you might
                    see a few other goodies your fishy family members would
                    enjoy trying. Don't worry too much about whether your pets
                    are omnivores, carnivores, or herbivores — even meat eaters
                    like to have a salad before a steak dinner! A few treat
                    ideas to try include:

                    As a general rule, fish shouldn't eat too many
                    carbohydrates; otherwise, they risk health issues. Instead,
                    stick to proteins and low-carb produce.

                <h2>How Often Do You Give Fish Treats?</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Treats are, well, treats, so moderation is the key here.
                    Spoiling your pets once a week is a great way to enjoy time
                    together without over-stuffing the pets with too many
                    calories.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    <img src={blog_children_img} alt="" />
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Plus, overfeeding can to lead to cloudy water, high ammonia
                    and/or nitrite levels, or a clogged aquarium filter.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Consider starting a routine. Maybe when you treat yourself
                    to pizza night on Saturdays, you also give a little
                    something extra to your nearby aquarium companions. While
                    waiting for your food to cook or arrive via delivery, enjoy
                    watching your fish nibbling away at their special treat.

                    If you're looking for more ways to observe and interact with
                    your fish, offer a few Stick'ems freeze-dried cubes
                    featuring brine and Mysis shrimp. Simply place the treat
                    inside the tank, against the glass, under the waterline.
                    Then, squish out the air to make the cube stick, and you're
                    ready for a fun feeding time. These new fish treats are
                    available online and on your favorite pet store shelves and
                    come in three varieties.

                    The delicious flavor is sure to bring even the pickiest of
                    eaters up to the glass for your viewing pleasure. Your fish
                    can nip at the cubes for up to 10 minutes. This is the
                    perfect time to snap a photo or two of your pets!

                <h2>Why Should I Give My Fish Treats?</h2>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Fish appreciate treats now and then. By offering up some
                    tasty morsels to your pets, they will look forward to
                    spending more time with you and come to the front of the
                    aquarium to see what you're up to — like reaching for their
                    treat container!
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Plus, offering treats to your fish is fun to watch. Whether
                    you attach the goodies to the glass wall or tuck them in the
                    aquarium substrate, you can get an up-close view of how they
                    nudge, poke, and slurp up their food.
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    Fish are family, so why not offer them a tempting,
                    pet-appropriate treat? Just don't go overboard! Treats are
                    an occasional indulgence, not a daily necessity.
